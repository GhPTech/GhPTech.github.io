<h2>Intellectual property</h2> 
<h3>and beyond</h3>
</div>
	
<div id="intro" class="container-fluid">
<h3>Introduction</h3><br>
<p>
Intellectual property consists of legal regulations governing an individual's or an organisation's right to control the use or dissemination of ideas or information, <a href="#references">[1]</a>.
Intellectual property rights include patents, copyright, industrial design rights, trademarks, plant variety rights, trade dress, and in some jurisdictions trade secrets, <a href="#references">[2]</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="history" class="container-fluid">
<h3>History</h3><br>
<p>
In most countries intellectual property rights were governed by different statutes and administered by disparate institutions, <a href="#references">[2]</a>. Royal rights used to be granted to individuals or corporations to produce and sale new devices. Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603) used to give such monopoly privileges, <a href="#references">[2]</a>.
<br>
The Statute of Monopolies (1624) and the British Statute of Anne (1710) are seen as the origins of patent law and copyright respectively, firmly establishing the concept of intellectual property, <a href="#references">[2]</a>.
The German equivalent was used with the founding of the North German Confederation whose constitution granted legislative power over the protection of intellectual property (Schutz des geistigen Eigentums) to the confederation. 
<br>
When the administrative secretariats established by the Paris Convention (1883) and the Berne Convention (1886) merged in 1893, they located in Berne, and also adopted the term intellectual property in their new combined title, the United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property.
The organisation subsequently relocated to Geneva in 1960, and was succeeded in 1967 with the establishment of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) by treaty as an agency of the United Nations, <a href="#references">[2]</a>. 
</p>

<div id="law" class="container-fluid">
<h3>Law and regulations</h3>
<p>
The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (commonly known as TRIPS) has contributed greatly to the expansion of intellectual-property law. The TRIPS Agreement obligates members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to establish and enforce minimum levels of copyright, patent, and trademark protection within their jurisdictions. Countries that fail to do so are subject to various WTO-administered trade sanctions, <a href="#references">[1]</a>.
</p>
</div>


<div id="issues" class="container-fluid">
<h3>Issues</h3>
<h4>Economic issues</h4>
<p>
The leaders of some developing countries contend that the TRIPS Agreement reflects and perpetuates a form of Western imperialism. Noting that most owners of intellectual property (e.g., the copyrights on popular movies and music, the patents on pharmaceutical products, and the trademarks of multinational food and clothing companies) reside in developed countries, these officials argue that strengthening intellectual-property rights unfairly raises the prices paid by consumers in the developing world. Accordingly, developing countries generally have been slow to implement TRIPS. Some economists, however, maintain that the long-term effect of the agreement will be to benefit developing countries by stimulating local innovation and encouraging foreign investment. Despite the existence of TRIPS, global rates of piracy of software, music, movies, and electronic games remain high, in part because many countries in Africa and Latin America have not met the deadlines imposed by the agreement for revamping their intellectual-property laws. Other countries, particularly in Asia, have formally complied with the agreement by passing new laws but have not effectively enforced them, <a href="#references">[1]</a>.
<br>
The tightening of laws governing intellectual property has been paralleled by a steady increase in the economic and cultural importance of intellectual-property rights. The entertainment industry has long been heavily dependent on intellectual property; the fortunes of record companies and movie studios are closely tied to their ability to enforce the copyrights on their products. Similarly, pharmaceutical companies have used the monopoly power created by their patent rights to charge high prices for their products, which has enabled them both to cover the enormous costs of developing new drugs and to make considerable profits. Other, newer industries have become equally or even more dependent on intellectual-property rights. The developers and distributors of computer software, for example, insist that their ability to remain in business is dependent on their power to prevent the unauthorized reproduction of their creations. Intellectual-property protection is widely thought to be even more important to the rapidly growing biotechnology industry, where the development of new techniques of genetic engineering or of new life-forms employing such techniques can be extremely expensive. Biotechnology firms argue that, if they were unable to prevent rivals from imitating their creations, they would not be able to recoup their costs and thus would have no incentive to invest in the research and development necessary for scientific breakthroughs. Companies selling goods and services over the Internet have made similar claims concerning the importance of their domain names, <a href="#references">[1]</a>.
</p>

<h4>Arguments</h4>
<p>
Utilitarians argue that the primary problem with intellectual products is that they can be copied easily and that they are “nonrivalrous”—i.e., consumption of them by one person does not prevent their consumption by others. These seemingly benign characteristics result in the danger that, unless the creators of intellectual products are given legal control over their reproduction, there will be little incentive to create them, because creators will be unable to recover their original production costs. Somewhat more specifically, utilitarians urge lawmakers to craft intellectual-property regulations carefully in order to strike an optimal balance between the socially desirable tendency of such laws to stimulate the creation of inventions and works of art and their partially offsetting tendency to curtail the widespread public enjoyment of these products, <a href="#references">[1]</a>.
<br>
An other theory was inspired by the writings of the 17th-century English philosopher John Locke, and specifically by his account of the origin of property rights. Proponents of this theory argue that a person who labours upon unowned resources has a natural right to the fruits of his efforts and that the state has a duty to respect and enforce that natural right. Theories in this vein are considered especially strong when applied to items such as books, music, and simple inventions, which are created primarily through intellectual labour and which are commonly fashioned from raw materials (facts and ideas) that lie in the public domain, <a href="#references">[1]</a>.
<br>
An argument that grew out of the writings of the 18th- and 19th-century German philosophers Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and out of a sentiment, common in western Europe, that artists and authors should enjoy certain “moral rights.” This approach is premised on the notion that private-property rights are crucial to the satisfaction of fundamental human needs, among which is the need for creative expression. Intellectual-property rights are thus justified either because they protect artifacts through which authors, artists, and inventors have expressed their “wills” or because they create social and economic conditions conducive to creativity, <a href="#references">[1]</a>.

<h3>Trends</h3>
<p>
Despite the strengthening of intellectual-property laws, the growing economic and cultural importance of intellectual-property rights, and a widespread view that such rights are socially desirable, the future of intellectual property remains in some doubt. Intellectual-property rights are threatened principally by the proliferation of technologies that facilitate the violation of copyright and patent rules, <a href="#references">[1]</a>.
In 2008 a U.S. federal appeals court ruled that free licenses, which grant the freedom to use copyrighted materials in exchange for adherence to certain terms of usage, distribution, and modification, “set conditions on the use of copyrighted work” and are thus enforceable under copyright law. In the event that the conditions are violated, the license disappears, thereby resulting in copyright infringement. The ruling was a legal milestone for open-source software—computer software that allows readers to view its programming or source code, improve it, and then redistribute the resulting software in its modified form, <a href="#references">[1]</a>.
To combat the threat and to provide themselves with effective protection, many developers have turned to technological shields or to alternative sources of revenue. Encryption systems for music, movies, and software, “terminator genes” that prevent the natural reproduction of genetically engineered plants, and government prizes and subsidies for artistic or technical advances may eventually partially replace intellectual-property law in some areas. Nevertheless, the system of intellectual-property rules is likely to play an evolving and vital role in economic and social life in the remainder of the 21st century, <a href="#references">[1]</a>.
